# Fire Fence
An open source network distributor.

# What is Fire Fence?
Fire Fence is an initiative forked from [IPFire](https://github.com/ipfire/ipfire-2.x). [IPFire](https://ipfire.org) is a robust linux-based operating system used for network firewalling. The goal of Fire Fence is to add capabilities to IPFire so it can be more useful for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) scenarios. Corporate system admins generally want their firewalls separate from other aspects of their operating system to prevent unnecessary security breaches. Having a device firewall that is separate from a hypervisor client and/or network storage is ideal in their use case. For small businesses which require modular deployments of assets from one managed device, this is not an ideal scenario. Remote work has made it even more necessary to have a more customizable network device that can do all tasks securely in a residential environment. 

# What Fire Fence is not...
Fire Fence is not a commercial grade project. I highly suggest you use IPFire if you are working as a system admin for a medium to large business.

# What will Fire Fence do that IPFire does not?
+ Hypervisor
+ ZFS NAS
+ Site-to-Site
+ And more...

# What other objectives will Fire Fence have?
+ Update WebGUI

# When can we expect some code?
The first update will contain WebGUI modifications, including skinning options. This will ensure I don't have to recreate any web interface later based on backend work.

# List of changes
Refer to GitHub commits for all changes made from original IPFire 2.x development.
